# When there is a variable named "sample", then Conjure will treat that node as the primary sample set to generate. So,
# instead of repeating all lines and variables in the file, it will only repeatedly generate the named variable.  In
# this case, we use the "combine" variable type.  With that type, Conjure will expect to either have a "list" property
# directly specified, or it will read the following lines up to the endToken (a blank line by default) and treat them as
# entries in the list.  Here we change the endToken so that we can have more whitespace for readability.  Blank lines
# and comments are still ignored. Each time 'sample' is generated, the 'combine' type will simply generate each item in
# the list in order.
${name:"sample", type:"combine", endToken:"---"}
The current time is ${now}.  Lottery numbers are:
${type:"minmax", min:0, max:99},${type:"minmax", min:0, max:99},${type:"minmax", min:0, max:99},${type:"minmax", min:0, max:99},${type:"minmax", min:0, max:99}
The winning color is ${colors}.

# Since the "sample" variable is now finished, other named variables can be specified independently
${name:"now", type:"time", format:"yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss Z"}

# The 'colors' variable just shows that when specified independently, the randomChoice variables can also have their
# 'list' be supplied as the non-blank lines that follow the variable definition.  When referenced, a value will be
# chosen at random and generated.
${name:"colors", type:"randomChoice"}
